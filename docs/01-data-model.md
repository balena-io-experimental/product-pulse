# About the model
Here's a high-level look at our data model for Product Pulse. We made these criteria as generic as possible so that a user could see how to connect each criteria to relevant data that will come from their product repo or project tracking tool.

We based our data model on how balena product builders create and manage their products, the challenges they face, and based on experiences and anecdotes gathered from product meetings. To ensure that we're inclusive for all types of projects and products, we ran a number of exercises to represent highly technical products as well as low and no-code-type products.

**Direction**
* Criterion 1 (low): Communicates how to contribute
* Criterion 2 (high): Same person approves of changes
* Criterion 3 (med): Same person makes changes
* Criterion 4 (low): People get assigned to issues

**Maintenance**
* Criterion 1 (high): Has had recent changes
* Criterion 2 (high): Open to close issue ratio is less than $X%
* Criterion 3 (low): Data is organized
* Criterion 4 (medium): Communication with issues
* Criterion 5 (medium): Explains architecture

**Community**
* Criterion 1 (low): Has more than $X positive sentiment (likes/watches/stars)
* Criterion 2 (low): Has 3rd party development
* Criterion 3 (high): Has 3rd party contributions
* Criterion 4 (high): Has users

We believe that our data model is generic and extensible enough to allow users to map these scores to the data from their products or project management tools.

## Defining the scores

We determined that a successful product has Direction, Maintenance, and Community. These three principles represent important components in keeping a project well-maintained and valuable to its users.

* **Direction** refers to criteria and signal that lets you know that a product or project has direction, vision, and organization behind it.
* **Maintenance** refers to criteria and signal that lets you know that there is work being done to progress the roadmap and milestones of the project.
* **Community** refers to criteria and signal that lets you know there are external users of the product who are contributing work and feedback.
