# Product Pulse roadmap

By defining and building a data model that can be interfaced by any product repo or project management tool, we empower users to integrate any of their work into this scoring tool. We don't want just one way for users to connect Product Pulse.

We want offer a backend service that provides endpoints for:
* JSON output of data so you can interpret and visualize the data as you see useful
* Badge output so you can add it to your readme or website to see product health
* An embeddable "card" to use on a custom website or dashboard
